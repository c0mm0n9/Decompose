# Java Method Signature Analyzer

This project consists of two Java classes, `BadIntrospectAlternative` and `Decompose`, designed to analyze and reflect on method signatures and their components in Java.

## BadIntrospectAlternative

The `BadIntrospectAlternative` class provides functionality similar to JavaScript functionality, returning:
- **Method Title**: The name of the method.
- **Description**: The first line of comments associated with the method.
- **Parameters**: A list of parameters including their types, names, and optional comments.
- **Comments**: Additional comments associated with the method.

### Example Usage
The `main` method demonstrates how to use the `getSignature` method to analyze a sample method declaration.

## Decompose

The `Decompose` class uses Java reflection to inspect the methods of a specified class. It retrieves:
- **Method Name**: The name of the method.
- **Return Type**: The return type of the method.
- **Parameter Types**: A list of parameter types for each method.
- **Modifiers**: The access modifiers (e.g., public, private) of the methods.

### Example Usage
The `main` method prints the details of all declared methods in the `Decompose` class.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the Java files using a compatible Java Development Kit (JDK).
3. Run the classes to analyze method signatures and their details.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher
